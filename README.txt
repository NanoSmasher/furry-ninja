A test game to develop my skills in love 2d 0.9 and github.

Otherwise, you have the so-called license of something that goes like this:

You can use, modify, relicense, etc if you agree that:
- I claim not liable for any damages using any of my uploaded codes/files/software.
- You agree to accept all responsibilities for whatever could potential go wrong.

Hopefully, nothing will go wrong. To play my game:
1) Get LÖVE 0.9.0 found: https://love2d.org/
2) download the zip version of the game to the right
3) unpack the zip and rezip it so that main.lua is on the zip file
*NOTE: that means you should not have the folder "guardian-angel" in the zip file.
4) rename the extension to .love
5) drag file to v0.9 of love.exe
